# 🤖 AI_Model

Welcome to **AI_Model** — an AI-powered backend framework designed to serve as the foundation for intelligent test-taking, conversational systems, or NLP-powered tools. This repo is under active development and aims to evolve into a modular, scalable, and production-ready AI model integration stack.


## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is built with the goal of integrating AI models (LLMs or custom NLP models) into a Python-based backend architecture. You can extend this model to build:

- 🧠 AI-based mock test systems  
- 💬 Chatbots or virtual assistants  
- 📊 Data analysis pipelines with smart querying  
- ✍️ AI writing assistants or summarization tools
