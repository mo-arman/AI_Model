# 🤖 AI_Model

Welcome to **AI_Model** — an AI-powered backend framework designed to serve as the foundation for intelligent test-taking, conversational systems, or NLP-powered tools. This repo is under active development and aims to evolve into a modular, scalable, and production-ready AI model integration stack.


## 🚀 Project Overview

This project is built with the goal of integrating AI models (LLMs or custom NLP models) into a Python-based backend architecture. You can extend this model to build:

- 🧠 AI-based mock test systems  
- 💬 Chatbots or virtual assistants  
- 📊 Data analysis pipelines with smart querying  
- ✍️ AI writing assistants or summarization tools

├── scripts/ # Utility scripts, model training, or inference code
├── requirements.txt # Python dependencies
└── README.md # You're reading it :)


## 📦 Features (Planned & Upcoming)

- [ ] Load and serve LLM or NLP models using HuggingFace or OpenAI  
- [ ] Create REST API endpoints using FastAPI or Flask  
- [ ] Integrate vector DB (e.g., FAISS or Chroma) for semantic search  
- [ ] Add test interface for AI-based assessments  
- [ ] Deploy the model via Docker or Render
